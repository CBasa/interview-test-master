Steps:
1. Complete BusyFlightsResponse class attributes
2. Create clients for the two suppliers Crazy Air and Tough Jet
3. Create service to retrieve flights from each supplier and then aggregate results
    - use try/catch block when retrieving flights from each supplier
    -
4. Convert BusyFlight request to respective requests for each supplier to retrieve flights from each one
5. Map responses from each supplier to BusyFlights Response format with new converter classes
	Main differences:
		Crazy Air:
			- cabinclass attribute not required
			- convert ISO_LOCAL_DATE_TIME('2011-12-03T10:15:30') to ISO_DATE_TIME('2011-12-03T10:15:30+01:00[Europe/Paris]')
		Tough Jet:
			- fare needs to be calculated based on basePrice*(1-(discount/100))*(1 + (tax / 100.00)) (discount is in percentage, assuming tax is also percentage)
			- convert ISO_INSTANT('2011-12-03T10:15:30Z') to ISO_DATE_TIME('2011-12-03T10:15:30+01:00[Europe/Paris]')
		Both:
			- need to specify value for supplier attribute in BusyFLights response to show if from Tough Jet or Crazy Air
6. Collect into one list and order by fare
8. Return final ordered list

9. Create mock responses for CrazyAirClient and ToughJetClient
10. Add field validations for request/response models
11. Create Postman collection
